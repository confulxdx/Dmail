# Dmail
Decentralized encrypted mail system base on Conflux Block Chain. you can use this system send encrypted mail. and this system can use in local http serverÔºÅ 
# Why is information encrypted?
Because the blockchain information is open and transparent, if it is not encrypted, everyone can see it. The main purpose of encryption is to realize point-to-point communication. Although the information is encrypted, the blockchain address is traceable.
# Security of private key and public key
The public key and private key of this system can be generated randomly at the time of initialization, which has nothing to do with the CFX Wallet Key. Replace at any time. The sender encrypts the data through your public key on the blockchain. After receiving the message, you decrypt it through the local private key. The local secret key storage adopts symmetric encryption technology. Please protect your local private key to store the password. This is a typical asymmetric encryption process. Because of the use of bitcoin encryption algorithm secp256k1, the security of the system is very high.
# What is token or Coin?
The token was converted from CFX 1:1 for internal NFT casting and trading. This project is based on the concept of open source, each NFT only needs one token. Note that the transaction registration function will consume 1 token, and the purchase of NFT will also consume 1 token. Tokens can be transferred to other addresses. It can also be converted to CFX extraction.
# Why use token mode?
Because in order to facilitate the contract processing, improve the processing speed and security, the token and CFX and can be exchanged at the same value. Therefore, it is not a token similar to erc20, but a data exchange in the middle.
